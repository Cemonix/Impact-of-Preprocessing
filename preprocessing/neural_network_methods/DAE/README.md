1. Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the denoised and the original clean images. Lower MSE values indicate better denoising performance. However, MSE may not always correlate well with perceived visual quality.

2. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR): Commonly used in image processing, PSNR is a measure of the peak error between the original and the reconstructed image. Higher PSNR values generally indicate better denoising quality.

3. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM): SSIM is a perception-based model that considers changes in structural information, luminance, and contrast. Unlike MSE, SSIM can be more aligned with human visual perception. A higher SSIM value (close to 1) indicates better reconstruction quality.
